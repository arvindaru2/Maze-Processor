Control Hazard Logic:

1) Branch 
It can be decided earlier in EX stage by forwarding the value of CC. Need to introduce a NOP between load and BR.
Need to flush two stages if mispredicted. It can be done by setting registers in IF/ID and ID/EX to NOP.

2) JMP/RET
The address is calculated in EX stage. 
Need to flush two stages if mispredicted. It can be done by setting registers in IF/ID and ID/EX to NOP.

3) JSR/JSRR
The address is calculated in EX stage. 
Need to flush two stages if mispredicted. It can be done by setting registers in IF/ID and ID/EX to NOP.

Let R7 = PC be set normally in later stages.

4) TRAP
Detected in WB stage.


PS:
a. Need to consider control instructions which can be in MEM and WB stage when prediction is done early in EX stage.
