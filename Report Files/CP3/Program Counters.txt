Our program counters will account for the following:

1) Hits and misses in both hierarchy levels
2) Misprediction of branches (Ratio)
3) Stalls in different stages of the pipeline

The counters are stored in memory when evicted from the registers and the registers are cleared. Counter register values are restored on reads.
